Ninja Search - the Greasemonkey Script
--------------------------------------

Description
===========

Every annoyed by HTML drop down lists that are too long, not ordered or in some other way difficult/slow to find and select an item? Ninja Search - the Greasemonkey Script is for you.

Every web page you visit will have its `<select>` elements suffixed with a small Ninja Search icon. When you click this, the `<select>` drop down element is converted into a text field with intelligent autocompletion. When you select an element, the text field disappears and the original `<select>` element returns with the desired selected item.
